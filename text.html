                <p> I have honed a particular skill-set from various positions held over time that are unrivaled with client engagement. I'm highly analytical, while very personalble. Working for both the federal government and private sector have caused me to be adaptable and effecient. I am capable of being apart of a team while still maintaining a high standard of autonomy. I work best at elaborating from existing procedures and forming a script, while retaining integrity to the job's objective. In my most recent position I have acclimated a consitent base of agents and clients who request me by name based off my proffessionalism and ability to convey informatoin in a concise, while informative manner. I'm looking to bring my methodical thinking and interpersonal skills into a role in which I can aid in achieiving a company's mission statement.
